# Contribution Guidelines

This project has a [contributor code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), by participating in this project you agree to abide its terms.

From here on, the word _server_ and _community_ will be used interchangebly and will mean the same thing. 

## Quality Standard

There is no real metric provided by Discord that can be used to evaluate a server by anyone. However a maintainer will manually review the community for a period of time (mostly 3-7 days) before it can get accepted. 

Only technical or technology-related communities are considered as an initial requirement. A community that's meant for people to hang out with no real active support channel will not be considered as technical. There are certain categories a technical community can fall under. **Generic**, **Niche**, and **Project**. There are some distinct requirements for each of them.

Generic servers try to cover multiple technical domains in one instead a specific, i.e., a server that offers support for all programming languages vs. a server that offers Java only. Generic servers are most likely to attract a lot of people in a short period of time, and  more likely to be short lived as it becomes more and more difficult to maintain over time. For this reason, a stricter requirement, a generic server needs to be at least a year old with active moderation and activity on a daily basis (excluding the off-topic channels). This particular precondition affects generic servers only.

Niche servers are the opposite of Generics, they're geared toward a smaller domain. The requirement of a nich server's age is minimum six months. 

Project servers are part of associate communities of open-source projects or content creators (e.g., Twitch streamers, YouTube creators). Since the activity and growth of the server depends on the creator's content itself, they can be accepted as soon there's daily or semiweekly activity. If you maintain an open-source project you might also be interested in [Discord's own open-source recognition](https://discord.com/open-source).

All of three types of server should meet the the following requirements:
 - An active moderation team, it's rare for a successful moderation to be run by a single administrator. But as long as the moderation is ongoing it's okay
 - A server needs to be active (on-topic channels) on a daily or semiweekly basis (except Generic)
 - All the channels must follow Discord's [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [ToS](https://discord.com/terms). 

## Prepare the Template
