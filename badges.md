# Awesome Server Badges
Servers are assigned to badges that they conform to. Some badges may redirect to you an external link that they refer, like a homepage or GitHub repository. A badge doesn't necessarily mean that the server is better than the others; it's etched only to represent a server's validity, popularity or assets. Selected badges for one server **doesn't** relate to [Discord's own](https://discordia.me/en/badges) badges.

#### Git Badge
This is one of the important badges, 'cause it shows the server's contribution to open source, mainly Discord bot developments. Upon clicking it redirects to the hosted git repository e.g., GitHub, Gitlab.
