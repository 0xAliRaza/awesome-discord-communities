# Awesome Server Badges
Servers are assigned to badges that they conform to. Some badges may redirect to an external link that the servers generally refer to, e.g., a homepage or official repository. A badge doesn't necessarily mean that the server is better than the others; it's etched to represent a server's validity, activity, and wiki. Badges selected for a server **doesn't** relate to [Discord's own](https://discordia.me/en/badges) badges.
