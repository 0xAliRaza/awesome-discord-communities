# Awesome Server Badges
Servers are assigned to  one or multiple badges that they conform to. Some badges may redirect to an external link that the servers generally refer to, e.g., a homepage or official repository. A badge doesn't necessarily mean that the server is better than the others; it's to represent a server's validity, activity, and wiki. Badges selected for a server **doesn't** relate to [Discord's own set of badges](https://discordia.me/en/badges).
